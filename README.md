# BP-NeuralNet-RL-Robocode
* Implemented neural network with backpropagation learning using Java to train XOR problem.
- Integrated reinforcement learning with look-up-table to train robot tank based on Robocode environment, and compared the performance of On-policy with Off-policy.
* Replaced LUT with six neural nets for each action, and configured optimum hyper-parameter, realizing the significant raise of wining rate from 55% to 95%.
